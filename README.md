## Contribution

SmartStop iOS app is an Internship Project built-on Cross-platform.
In this project, I have worked as Backend developer .

## Description
1. When a driver is pulled over, the driver presses a button on their phone saying that “I’m
being pulled over”.
2. Text is automatically sent to driver’s contact
3. An algorithm calculates the nearest officer in the vicinity with the application running on
their smart phone.
4. Notification with Officer name and badge number is sent back to the driver’s phone.
5. Driver information packet which includes driver’s license, insurance information,
concealed handgun info, some personal things about the driver that have been
volunteered (like they are a coach, teacher, father, mother), and special considerations or
things that could impact the driver’s ability to interact with the officer (disability, hearing
issues, PTSD, Bipolar, Medication, etc) are sent back to the officer app.

6. This is information that will be valuable for officers to know up front. They also are
encouraged to enter information about what they do like: I am a coach, I am a teacher,
administrator, student, entrepreneur, father, mother. This adds some context to the driver
and allows the officer to know more about the person.
